The app is basically a transport brokerage app, where the user will record leads manually for orders. The app will then go through the leads and create then basically send enquiries to various truck brokers who will then send their respective rates. Then we will choose the best rate and add a margin to it and pitch the detail to the lead/contact. If accepted we proceed with the offer. Leads will come from indiamart etc. Also we will keep record of the rates of various truck brokers etc.
